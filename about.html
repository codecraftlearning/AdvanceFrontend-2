        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            At the heart of every great meal is passion — and ours has been cooking for over 8 years. Born in Toronto
            and perfected over time, our award-winning pizza blends authentic flavors, fresh ingredients, and a love for
            quality that you can taste in every slice.

            We believe pizza isn’t just food — it’s an experience. From the first crisp bite to the last cheesy pull,
            our mission is to make every meal unforgettable. That’s why we craft each pizza with care, using the finest
            ingredients and a perfected recipe that has earned us accolades and loyal fans.

            Now, for the first time, the taste of Toronto’s finest is here in Gurgaon and Noida. Whether you crave
            cheesy classics or crave-worthy specialties, we’re here to satisfy your pizza dreams.
